# Non-Profit Supporter Data Analysis

## About

This project was created to serve as an item in my data anlyst portfolio. The dataset was taken from a political non-profit organiztion operiting in the United States. I took the dataset and removed any personal identifiable information and randomized the results so that it is no longer representative of the organization's supporters. 

The idea behind this project is to first take the data and clean it so that it is more suitable for an analysis. Next, we will analyze the supporter data to build targeting profiles based of the demographics of the current user base. These targeting profiles could be used to craft messaging, create advertising audiences, or better understand where to focus efforts.
